# trash_disposal_app

This project aims to help who need to separate trash for selective disposal. The user inputs a picture with the item and provides his location (currently via list to avoid personal data usage in the EU). The disposable item is identified and a suggestion as to where to dispose is given. 
Uses Google Vision API to detect the object in the image and Chat GTP API to get the disposal recommendations.
